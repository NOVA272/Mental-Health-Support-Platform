        <h2>Stress Relief Exercises</h2>
        <p>Exercise not only reduces stress hormones like cortisol and adrenaline but also boosts the production of endorphins, which are natural mood elevators. Regular physical activity can significantly enhance your overall mood, reducing feelings of anxiety and depression. Engaging in exercise improves the quality of your sleep, helping you feel more rested and less stressed. Additionally, exercise helps train your brain to respond to stress more effectively, reducing its negative impact. It also promotes better cardiovascular health, increases energy levels, and improves concentration and cognitive function. By incorporating stress relief exercises into your routine, you can build resilience, enhance your emotional well-being, and improve your overall quality of life.</p>
